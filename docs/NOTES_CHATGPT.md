# NOTES — ChatGPT (Spec Guardian & Prompt Writer)
Purpose: Persistent spec/prompt memory. New ChatGPT sessions should read this first.

Last updated: 2026-01-15 (Europe/Budapest)

---

## Current focus
- Keep implementation aligned with binding canonical specs (Phase 0 Netcode Readiness + GRFDTRDPU Appendix A).
- Produce prompts for Claude and Antigravity.
- Detect future multiplayer/backend pitfalls early (avoid rebuild).

---

## NEXT WORK PACKAGE — MASTER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Binding)
Purpose:
- Before asking Claude to code, run a full-project implementation planning round.
- Obtain independent detailed plans from Antigravity (architecture/audit) and Claude Code (implementation/PR breakdown).
- ChatGPT then synthesizes and proposes the final step-by-step plan + release breakdown for Ádám approval.

**Binding Steps for ChatGPT:**
1) **Read canonical/spec index + current status:**
   - `docs/START_HERE.md`
   - `docs/STATUS_WALKTHROUGH.md`
   - `baseline/pre-claude-stable/docs/CANONICAL_SOURCES_INDEX.md`
   - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GATES.md`
   - `quality/NETCODE_READINESS_AUDIT.md` + `STATE_SURFACE_MAP.md` + `MULTIPLAYER_TARGET_CHOICE.md`
2) **Ask Antigravity Gemini for a complete end-to-end implementation plan:**
   - architecture sequence
   - minimal-invasive refactor strategy
   - determinism/netcode readiness path
   - risk register + mitigation
   - recommended release/branch plan (frequent releases)
   - concrete deliverables + test checkpoints per phase
3) **Ask Claude Code for a complete end-to-end implementation plan:**
   - PR decomposition strategy (small PRs)
   - concrete code approach for fixed-timestep, command stream, deterministic IDs, seeded PRNG, snapshot surface export, ITransport stub
   - likely edge cases and failure modes
   - test plan per PR
4) **ChatGPT synthesizes:**
   - one coherent "Master Plan" with phases (Release 001..)
   - explicit dependencies
   - decisions needed from Ádám (max 3 questions)
   - minimal test scripts per release
5) **Only after Ádám approval: start issuing implementation prompts.**

> **BINDING RULE**: Do NOT start Claude coding before Master Plan approval.

**If you are a fresh chat, your first output is: request Antigravity plan + request Claude plan.**


## Principles (non-negotiable)
- Authority must be deterministic: fixed tick, command-stream only, deterministic IDs, seeded PRNG.
- Clear separation: authoritative state vs render-only state (do not sync render artifacts).
- Prefer minimal-touch shims first; deep refactors only when gates require it.

---

## What “done” looks like for Phase 0
- Fixed-timestep authority loop exists and is the only source of state advancement.
- Inputs become commands, applied in SimCore.step.
- serializeState exports authoritative surface; stable across runs given same seed + commands.
- ITransport exists with Local stub; future multiplayer swaps only transport.

---

## Next prompts
- Claude PR#1 kickoff prompt should reference:
  - baseline/pre-claude-stable/docs/CANONICAL_SOURCES_INDEX.md
  - main/docs/STATUS_WALKTHROUGH.md
  - main/docs/MAILBOX.md
  - main/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GATES.md
- Antigravity prompts should stay “docs/audits only” unless explicitly authorized.

---

## Write-access rule (Binding)
- ChatGPT is read-only on GitHub files.
- If ChatGPT wants to update docs (STATUS_WALKTHROUGH / MAILBOX / NOTES_* / START_HERE), it must:
  1) propose an exact patch (insert/replace lines),
  2) instruct Antigravity to apply ONLY that patch,
  3) require commit + push and return raw link + commit hash.
- Ádám does not commit. Antigravity is the default docs operator. Claude Code is the default code operator.

---

## Open questions for Ádám
- Confirm desired authority tick rate (default 20Hz).
- Confirm minimum supported command set for PR#1 (MOVE, STOP).

---

## Binding workflow reminders
- **Mailbox**: Agent-to-agent info sync only. No instructions there. Decisions flow via Ádám in chat.
- **Reference**: Always name files when referencing them (e.g. `docs/START_HERE.md`).
- **Publish Protocol**: After any push, report: `branch` + `commit hash` + `direct links to changed files` + `playable URL` (if applicable).
- **Versioning**: Follow policy in `docs/VERSIONING_ROLLBACK.md`.
- **Releases**: Check `docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md`. Prompt for Release Verification when milestone is near.
- **Prompt Delivery**: Output generated prompts **directly in chat** (paste-ready). Do not require Ádám to open MAILBOX.
