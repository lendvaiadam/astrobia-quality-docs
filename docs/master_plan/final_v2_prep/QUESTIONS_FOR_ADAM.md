**Date:** 2026-01-24
**Purpose:** All clarifying questions needed before writing MASTER_PLAN_FINAL_v2.md

---

## Format

Each question includes:
- **Decision it unlocks**
- **Section affected**
- **Blocker level:** BLOCKER (cannot write section without answer) or NON-BLOCKER (can proceed with default)

---

## Questions

### Q1: Replay System Scope
**Question:** Should Demo 1.0 include a replay system (command-log replay for debugging/review)?

**Options:**
- A) Defer to post-Demo 1.0 (no replay in initial release)
- B) Include basic command-log replay (store commands, replay deterministically)

**Decision Unlocks:** Whether to add ~1 release to Phase 1 for replay infrastructure.
**Section Affected:** Release Plan (Phase 1), Testing Strategy
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: A - defer)

---

### Q2: UI Framework Choice
**Question:** Which UI approach should the plan specify for the Command Queue Timeline and other UI elements?

**Options:**
- A) HTML/CSS overlays with vanilla JS (current approach, simplest)
- B) React integration (modern component model, more setup)
- C) Defer framework choice to implementation time (plan specifies behavior, not tech)

**Decision Unlocks:** Whether plan should mandate UI technology or remain technology-agnostic.
**Section Affected:** Architecture section, all UI-related releases
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: C - defer to implementation)

---

### Q3: PR Granularity
**Question:** Should the plan use Claude-style granular PRs (001.1, 001.2, etc.) or single-PR-per-release?

**Options:**
- A) Granular PRs (Claude style: multiple small PRs per release, more review checkpoints)
- B) Single PR per release (less overhead, faster merges)
- C) Flexible (plan describes work breakdown, implementer chooses PR granularity)

**Decision Unlocks:** How detailed to make the PR breakdown in the execution plan.
**Section Affected:** Release/Sprint/PR Plan (Section 12)
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: C - flexible)

---

### Q4: Command Queue Timeline Complexity
**Question:** The canonical spec (GRFDTRDPU 8.6) describes a full After Effects-style timeline. Should Demo 1.0 implement the full spec or a simplified subset?

**Options:**
- A) Full spec (per-unit PLAY/PAUSE, gummy stretch, loop toggle, repeat markers)
- B) Simplified (waypoint list only, no timeline visualization, basic loop support)
- C) Phased (basic in Phase 1, full timeline UI in Phase 2)

**Decision Unlocks:** UI scope for Phase 1 releases, affects complexity estimates.
**Section Affected:** Feature Implementation (Phase 1), UI Releases
**Blocker Level:** BLOCKER (affects scope of Phase 1)

---

### Q5: Direct Control Priority
**Question:** Direct Control (keyboard/gamepad input) is specified in canonical spec 8.6.9. When should it be implemented?

**Options:**
- A) Phase 1 (include with MOVE_ROLL, Release 011)
- B) Phase 2 (after multiplayer foundation)
- C) Post-Demo 1.0

**Decision Unlocks:** Whether Direct Control adds to Phase 1 scope.
**Section Affected:** Phase 1 releases, Feature Implementation
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: B - Phase 2)

---

### Q6: Training Mini-Games Scope
**Question:** The GRFDTRDPU spec requires training sessions (60 seconds, score 0-100). Should Demo 1.0 include actual mini-games or placeholder scoring?

**Options:**
- A) Full mini-games per feature (MOVE_ROLL training, WPN_SHOOT training, etc.)
- B) Placeholder (stub training scene, fixed score for testing)
- C) Deferred (training system exists but mini-games post-Demo)

**Decision Unlocks:** Whether to allocate releases for training game design/implementation.
**Section Affected:** GRFDTRDPU Implementation (Phase 1)
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: B - placeholder)

---

### Q7: Dark Side AI Complexity
**Question:** The canonical spec defines Dark Side mimicry, raids, and wreck capture. Should Demo 1.0 implement full AI or simplified behavior?

**Options:**
- A) Full spec (periodic mimicry polling, dynamic raid frequency, wreck capture mechanics)
- B) Simplified (scripted waves, no adaptive mimicry)
- C) Phased (basic raids in Demo 1.0, full mimicry post-Demo)

**Decision Unlocks:** AI complexity and release allocation.
**Section Affected:** Dark Side Implementation, Phase 2 scope
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: C - phased)

---

### Q8: Energy Network Visualization
**Question:** Should the plan include explicit UI for energy network coverage (transmission range visualization)?

**Options:**

- C) Debug-only (developer overlay, not player-facing)

**Decision Unlocks:** UI scope for energy system.
**Section Affected:** Economy UI releases
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: B - minimal)

---

### Q9: Matera Color Mixing UI
**Question:** Generators use complementary colors for 200% efficiency. Should Demo 1.0 include color mixing UI/feedback?

**Options:**
- A) Yes - show color wheel, efficiency preview
- B) Minimal - show input slots, show efficiency number
- C) Defer - single Matera type for Demo 1.0, colors post-Demo

**Decision Unlocks:** Economy system complexity.
**Section Affected:** Economy features, Resource UI
**Blocker Level:** NON-BLOCKER (default: C - defer colors)

---

### Q10: Multiplayer Scope Clarification
**Question:** Should Demo 1.0 target 2-player P2P only, or up to 4 players?

**Options:**
- A) 2-player P2P only (simpler networking, easier testing)
- B) 4-player mesh (full P2P mesh, more complex)
- C) 4-player with host (star topology, host-authoritative)

**Decision Unlocks:** Network architecture complexity, testing scope.
**Section Affected:** Multiplayer Stack (Phase 2)
**Blocker Level:** BLOCKER (affects architecture design)

### Q11: WebRTC Fallback Strategy
**Question:** If WebRTC fails (NAT issues), what fallback should Demo 1.0 support?

**Options:**
- A) TURN relay only (no additional fallback, use TURN servers)
- B) WebSocket fallback (additional code path, higher latency)
- C) No fallback (fail with helpful message, require good NAT)

**Decision Unlocks:** Network reliability vs complexity trade-off.
**Section Affected:** Multiplayer Stack, Risk Mitigation
