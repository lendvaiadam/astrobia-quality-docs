# Master Development Plan (Release 000)

> "Release 000" is the dedicated planning phase that MUST occur before any Release 001 coding begins.

## Purpose
To force a "measure twice, cut once" discipline. We are transitioning a prototype to a Host-Authoritative Netcode Architecture. This requires a complete mental map of the end-state before writing individual shims.

## Expectations (Binding)
- **Repo-First**: Plans must be committed here, not just output in chat.
- **Depth**: "~40 pages" is the aspiration. We value completeness over brevity here.
- **Structure**:
  1. **Proof-of-Read**: List of sources actually opened.
  2. **Target Definition**: What "Netcode Readiness" means concretely.
  3. **Feature Roadmap**: GRFDTRDPU evolutionary stages.
  4. **Architecture**: SimCore vs World split.
  5. **Persistence/Multiplayer**: Strategy for data handling.
  6. **Release Schedule**: Concrete milestones (001...010).
  7. **Worker Pool Plan**: How 5 parallel workers will be utilized.
