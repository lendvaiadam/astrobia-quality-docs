# STATUS_WALKTHROUGH — Live Project State
Purpose: This is the living walkthrough of "where we are now", what is next, and who is doing what.
Stable rules live in docs/START_HERE.md. Canonical specs are indexed elsewhere.

## Current baseline
- Stable starting ref: baseline/pre-claude-stable
- Canonical index (stable): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lendvaiadam/asterobia/baseline/pre-claude-stable/docs/CANONICAL_SOURCES_INDEX.md
- Preflight: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lendvaiadam/asterobia/baseline/pre-claude-stable/quality/NETCODE_PREFLIGHT.md

---

## Direction (what we are building toward)
Phase 0 "Netcode Readiness" (binding):
- Fixed-timestep authority loop (no dt-based authority).
- Command-stream input only.
- Deterministic IDs + seeded PRNG.
- Authoritative snapshot surface export.
- ITransport abstraction (Local now, later multiplayer/backend).

Multiplayer target:
- Host-authoritative as MVP; backend Phase 1 = Auth + Lobby/Signaling.

- **Status**: TO DO

---

## Who is doing what (roles)
- Ádám: Hungarian ideas + decisions + testing + relaying messages between AIs (no Git ops).
- Agents (Antigravity/Claude): branches/PRs, push changes, merge to main after Ádám explicit approval.
- Antigravity (Gemini): audits, repo mapping, preflight checks, doc snapshots (no deep refactors unless asked).
- Claude Code: implements code PRs per canonical Phase 0 rules.
- ChatGPT: writes prompts + checks plans against canonical docs.

---

## Blockers / Decisions needed from Ádám
- (none currently)

2) Read docs/STATUS_WALKTHROUGH.md + docs/MAILBOX.md.
3) Read your agent notes file (docs/NOTES_*.md).
4) Continue from the top item in NOW.
