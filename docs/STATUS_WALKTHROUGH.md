# STATUS WALKTHROUGH (Living Document)

## NOW
(Current focus: Workflow Finalization)

## WORK PACKAGE ROLE MAP (BINDING)
- Antigravity MUST assign and publish the Role Map for each Work Package.
- Ádám MAY override role assignments by explicit instruction.
- Execution MUST NOT start until the Role Map is published here.
- Roles are dynamic per Work Package; do not force tasks into fixed specialties.
- Required format:
  - Worker-1: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-2: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-3: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-4: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-5: <role> — <scope>
