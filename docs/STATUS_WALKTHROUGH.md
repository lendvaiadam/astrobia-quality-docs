# STATUS WALKTHROUGH (Living Document)

## NOW
### Current Work Package
- **RELEASE 000 — MERGE ROUND**
  Synthesize the Final Executable Master Plan from the Claude and Antigravity drafts.

### Tasks
- [x] **Antigravity** delivers Coverage Matrix + Open Decisions + Change Requests (committed)
- [ ] **Claude** delivers MASTER_PLAN_MERGED_v1 (committed)
- [ ] **Ádám** approves Merged Plan

### Deliverables
- `docs/master_plan/merge/` artifacts (Antigravity)
- `docs/RELEASE_000_MASTER_PLAN_MERGED.md` (Claude)

### Done When
- Merged plan exists and Ádám approves direction.

### Next After This
- Release 001 PR-by-PR execution plan + start implementation.

## WORK PACKAGE ROLE MAP (BINDING)
- Antigravity MUST assign and publish the Role Map for each Work Package.
- Ádám MAY override role assignments by explicit instruction.
- Execution MUST NOT start until the Role Map is published here.
- Roles are dynamic per Work Package; do not force tasks into fixed specialties.
- Required format:
  - Worker-1: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-2: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-3: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-4: <role> — <scope>
  - Worker-5: <role> — <scope>
