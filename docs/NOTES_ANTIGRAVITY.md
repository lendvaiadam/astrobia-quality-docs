# NOTES — Antigravity (Gemini) (Auditor & Snapshot Operator)

## Always-on Documentation & Versioning Protocol (MANDATORY)

Antigravity is responsible for keeping canonical status accurate on main.

### Required after every Claude delivery
1) Audit against binding specs
2) Run tests and record results
3) Merge to main (or report blocker)
4) Update docs/STATUS_WALKTHROUGH.md on main:
   - Mark Release DONE / OPEN
   - Record branch + commit SHAs
   - Include HU smoke test steps + result
5) Push commits (no “done” without SHA)

### Required outputs
- main HEAD SHA
- docs commit SHA
- RAW links to updated docs
- NEXT UP as defined by STATUS_WALKTHROUGH.md

## Double-Check Auditor Protocol
For every delivery (Claude branch):
1. **Hidden Risk Audit:** Proactively look for inconsistencies and netcode pitfalls.
2. **Block on Violation:** Stop merge if binding docs or determinism are compromised.
3. **Value Add:** Propose 1–3 "next small steps" (≤1 day) to reduce risk (OPTIONAL).

Purpose: Persistent auditor memory. New Antigravity chat windows must read this first.

## Role boundaries
Allowed:
- Audits, repo mapping, risk registers, documentation snapshots, link indexing.
- Preflight checks / detection tooling (search for forbidden patterns).
- Small doc updates when requested.

Not allowed (unless explicitly asked by Ádám):
- Deep refactors in Game.js / Unit.js
- Implementing Phase 0 code changes (fixed tick / command pipeline / seeded RNG)
Default output: MD files under /quality or /docs.

---

## Current status
- Baseline branch prepared: baseline/pre-claude-stable
- Published: docs/STATUS_WALKTHROUGH.md and docs/MAILBOX.md
- Published: docs/NOTES_CLAUDE.md
- Preflight exists: quality/NETCODE_PREFLIGHT.md (baseline branch)

---

## What to do next (if asked)
- Append RAW-friendly absolute links to CANONICAL_SOURCES_INDEX (append-only, no edits).
- Update audits when code changes (netcode readiness, state surface).
- Keep REPO_REALITY_MAP current after structural changes.

---

## Handoff expectations
- If Claude requests proof/audit, respond with a short MD file + raw link.
- If anything looks like deep refactor, stop and ask Ádám for explicit permission.

---

## Binding workflow reminders
- **Mailbox**: Agent-to-agent info sync only. No instructions there. Decisions flow via Ádám in chat.
- **Reference**: Always name files when referencing them (e.g. `docs/START_HERE.md`).
- **Publish Protocol**: After any push, report: `branch` + `commit hash` + `direct links to changed files` + `playable URL` (if applicable).
- **Versioning**: Follow policy in `docs/VERSIONING_ROLLBACK.md`.
- **Releases**: Suggest release when milestone matches `docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md` (YES/NO + reason).
- **Release Execution**: If approved, tag + update `public/versions.json`.
- **Prompt Delivery**: If generating a prompt for Claude, return it **directly in chat**. Do not tell Ádám to read MAILBOX.
- **Ádám Test Checklist (Mandatory)**: After every implementation step, output a checklist (Steps + Expected + Risk Focus).
